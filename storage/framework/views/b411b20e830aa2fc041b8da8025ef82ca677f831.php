        <p>Welcome aboard!</p>
        <p>So you have purchased our AVITA Smart device hardware and are starting to use the AVITA Smart device software
            and all its functionalities! Any information you share with us (e.g. for creating an AVITA Account) will
            help us to provide you with services related to AVITA Smart devices and to improve them to make them even
            better. We explain here our ways of collecting and using information, and how we protect your privacy. In
            this privacy policy, “personal data” means information that can be used to identify an individual, either
            from that information alone or from that information and other information we have access to about that
            individual. We collect both personal and non-personal data to enable and facilitate the best user experience
            possible.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Information Safety Safeguards</h3>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access,
            disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial
            procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We have put in place the following security
            procedures and technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your personal data is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.</li>
            <li>All data saved in the back-end is classified into different levels based on the importance and
                sensitivity of the data, e.g. whether the data contains personal data.</li>
            <li>In the data centers, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology
                and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.</li>
            <li>Data exchanged between AVITA devices and servers are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”).</li>
            <li>There is an optional two-step verification process when users access their AVITA Accounts.</li>
            <li>There is a regular review of information collection, storage, and processing practices, including
                physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
            <li>Access is restricted to AVITA employees and Third Party Service Providers who need to know the
                information in order to process it, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality
                obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations.</li>
            <li>There are also access controls for all server clusters used for cloud-based data storage and process.
            </li>
            <li>Most data used for AVITA’s products and/or services is stored in a storage system. By using a column
                family-based access control mechanism, AVITA employees are only allowed access to the data column
                families they are granted access to.</li>
            <li>Please note also that for the above, AVITA may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by AVITA
                to process or back up your personal data. Currently, AVITA has data centers in Beijing and Singapore. As
                a result, we may transfer to and store your personal data at our overseas facilities. However, this does
                not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal data in accordance with this Privacy
                Policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information safety is very important to us. We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal
            data. Through our protective measures above, especially encrypted storage and transmission, your data is as
            secure as it can be. Certain details of encrypted data cannot be accessed by anyone except by you.</p>
        <h3>When this Privacy Policy applies</h3>
        <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products and services offered by a third party. AVITA products and
            services may include a third party’s products or services. When you use such products or services, they may
            collect your information too. For this reason, we strongly suggest you to read the third party’s privacy
            policy as you have taken time to read ours. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third parties
            use the personal data that they collect from you. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites linked to
            our services.</p>
        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>We consider it the responsibility of parents to monitor their children’s use of our products and services.
            Nevertheless, it is our policy not to require personal data from minors or offer to send any promotional
            materials to persons in that category. AVITA does not seek or intend to seek to receive any personal data
            from minors. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided AVITA with
            personal data without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the personal data is removed and
            unsubscribe them from any of the applicable AVITA services.</p>
        <h3>Updates to the Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on
            all the AVITA website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Such
            changes to our Privacy Policy shall apply from the time that we post the same on the AVITA website. Your
            continued use of products and services on the websites, mobile phones, and/or any other device will be taken
            as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We will seek your fresh consent before we collect more personal
            data from you or when we wish to use or disclose your personal data for new purposes.</p>
